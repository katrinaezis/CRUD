His jeans were hand-crafted by children in Thailand when he went there on a missionary trip to convert third world contries to veganism, but the quesiton still stands...which pair?:hipsters/hipster3.jpg:That beard tho. This hipster is a lumbersexual to the core. He wears flannel and cuts down trees unironically.:hipsters/hipster4.jpg:Julian Bossiere in all his magnificance. I swear I got his permission to use this picture. This is only a little creepy. Sup Julian.:hipsters/hipster5.jpg:This hipster uses more product on his mustache in one day than most men will use over their life-time. He has perfect vision, but wears glasses anyways.
